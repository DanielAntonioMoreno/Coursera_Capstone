            "source": "A frequent problem that lawmakers have to face is when to go into a \"state of emergency\" or give the order for citizens to shelter in place. When there are particular dangerous weather conditions, governments have the ability to give the order to citizens to \"shelter in place\" meaning that they should not be seen outside of their own properties. The lawmakers do this in an attempt to prevent unnecessary loss of life by commuting in dangerous conditions. In even more dangerous circumstances they can start a state of emergency or urge citizens to evacuate. However, giving the order to shelter in place or to evacuate, lawmakers face the possibility of significantly harming the local economy, and putting citizens at the poverty level in even more dangerous conditions. My analysis can help lawmakers decide when to take steps to shut down roads in order to prevent accidents. Lawmakers would be able to set a threshold for the amount of accidents, and given past weather and accident data we can determine at what weather points do higher level of accidents tend to occur. I have decided to use a Linear Regression to show the relationship between the weather and the amount of accidents. "

In order to find all the accidents I went and got data from PennDOT (The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) and weather data from the NOAA. I looked at the year 2018 since that was the crash data that was available. A brief look at the data shows that there were approximately 11,000 automobile accidents in the year 2018 in Philadelphia. The weather was marked as 1 for normal, and with increasing numbers showing more hazardous weather. This allowed for a simple regression to be performed. "
